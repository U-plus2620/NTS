*THIS PLAN IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*

#The goal
The goal of this plan is to a communications methodolody to make use of all communication tools at the disposal of the ham radio operator.
The plan is based on the *PACE* method.
The criteria that differentiates the ranking between different levels and methods of the plan depend on 2 things;
1. How accessable the method is
2. How robust the method is
For instance NVIS propogation is more robust than than an Allstar repeater but is not as easily accesable to everyone due to a number of constraints.
It is within this mindset that drove me to these particular decisions. I am trying to make a plan that starts with the most accessable and down to the most robust.
