*THIS PLAN IS A WORK IN PROGRESS*

# The goal. 
The goal of this plan is to create a communications methodolody that makes use of all the communication tools at the disposal of the ham radio operator.
This plan was written using the *PACE* method. PACE is an acronym for:
Primary  
Alternate  
Contingent  
EMERGENCY  

The criteria that differentiates the ranking between different levels and methods of the plan depend on 2 things;
1. How accessable the method is
2. How robust the method is
For instance NVIS propogation is more robust than than an Allstar repeater but is not as easily accesable to everyone due to a number of constraints.
It is within this mindset that drove me to these particular decisions. I am trying to make a plan that starts with the most accessable and down to the most robust.

## The plan. 

1. **P**rimary (including weekly net)
   - Linked repeater system
2. **A**lternate
   - Repeater not linked
3. **C**ontingent, simplex
   - 144.425
   - 144.450
4. **E**MERGECY
   - 430.025 Digital
   - 40 meter NVIS

Primary.  
Linked repeater system.  
For loss of primary communication (e.g. cellular) and weekly net.  
The linked repeater system was chosen as primary for the following reasons;
- It covers a large area.
- Even from within an affected area one may still be able to use a repeater connected the linked system due to the repeaters being placed on high grounds for large coverage.
- For non emergency use, for instance our weekly nets, these repeaters are very accessable and comfortable to use

Alternate.   
Stand alone repeaters.  
For loss of link on the linked repeaters.  
The stand alone repeaters were chosen as Alternae for the following reasons;
- Due to the placement of the repeaters it is possible that a large number of operators can access one repeater and communicate on that repeater together.

Contingent.  
Simplex VHF.  
For loss of repeaters (e.g. power outage, jamming etc.)  
Simplex was chosen due to many operators having easier access to VHF than HF (as far as I know).

EMERGENCY.  
- UFH digital.  
- 40 meter nvis.  
If VHF simplex doesnt work for some reason.  
UHF digital was chosen due to UHF having good propogation in urban enviroments along with digital having good range and (sometimes) error correction to further compliment UHF capabilities.  
NVIS is a last ditch effort for voice comms or digital comms.   
NVIS is the last option being that an appropriate antenna and antenna instalation may prove to be problematic for most( as far as I know).
